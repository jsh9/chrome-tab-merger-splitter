# chrome-tab-merger-splitter

This is a Chrome and Edge extension to split a tab from a browser window, or merge a single-tab window into another browser window.

There is no built-in keyboard shortcut to achieve this in Chrome or Edge, which is why I wrote this extension to improve productivity.

## 1. Installation

Please go the Chrome Web Store to install it: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-merger-splitter/fckkfigeieganclanlhcmmiakfcafmbe


## 2. How to use

* To split a tab from the current browser window, use `Alt + Shift + X` (on macOS: `Option + Shift + X`)

* To merge a single-tab window into anthoer browser window, use `Alt + Shift + Z` (on macOS: `Option + Shift + Z`)
